\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
By now it is classical that one can understand singularities in prime characteristic local algebra/algebraic geometry through properties of the Frobenius endomorphism. A foundational result illustrating this is the celebrated theorem of Kunz characterizing the regularity of a noetherian scheme (in prime characteristic) in terms of whether a Frobenius pushforward on that scheme is flat. In this talk, I'll discuss a structural explanation of, that also recovers, the theorem of Kunz and other theorems of this ilk. Namely, Iâ€™ll discuss recent joint work with Ballard, Iyengar, Lank, and Mukhopadhyay where we show that over an $F$-finite noetherian scheme of prime characteristic high enough Frobenius pushforwards generate the bounded derived category.\linebreak
