\title{Constructing Equivariant\\ Homology Theories --- Part 3}
\date{Thursday, November 20, 2014}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this series of talks I will present a new machinery that, for arbitrary discrete groups $G$, produces generalized $G$-equivariant homology theories that, as the group~$G$ varies, are related by compatible induction and restriction structures.
The compatibility condition is expressed in terms of a double-coset formula, and in particular it implies that the coefficients form a Mackey functor and therefore L\"uck's proper equivariant Chern characters become available.
I will then show that this machinery can be used to construct compatible induction and restriction structures for the equivariant homology theories with coefficients in algebraic $K$-theory (or Hochshild homology, or cyclic homology, or their topological variants, et cetera) of rings or even ring spectra, which appear in the Farrell-Jones isomorphism conjectures.
This is joint work with Holger Reich.
