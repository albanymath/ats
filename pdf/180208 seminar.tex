\begin{abstract}
The well-known trace map on matrices can be generalized to a map for a general module over a commutative ring. In this setting, the image of the trace map for an $R$-module~$M$ is its trace ideal, realized as the ideal generated by the homomorphic images of $M$ in~$R$. In this talk, I will discuss recent developments in the theory of trace ideals as well as applications in the understanding of centers of endomorphism rings and the existence of self-extensions for $R$-modules.
