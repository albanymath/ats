\large\noindent\textsc{Abstract.}
In joint work with Sonja Mapes, we investigate the class of rigid monomial ideals.  We show that the ideals in a particular subclass of rigid monomial ideals are lattice-linear and thus have a minimal poset resolution.  In turn, we use this result to give a description of the minimal free resolution of a larger class of rigid monomial ideals by using~$L(n)$, the lattice of all lcm-lattices of monomial ideals on~$n$ generators.  By fixing a stratum in~$L(n)$ where all ideals have the same total Betti numbers, we show that rigidity is a property which is upward closed in~$L(n)$.  Therefore, the minimal resolution of a rigid ideal contained in a fixed stratum can be constructed by relabeling the minimal resolution of a lattice-linear rigid ideal contained in said stratum.  In ongoing work, we work towards the construction of a minimal resolution of an arbitrary rigid ideal by focusing on an appropriate subposet of the lcm-lattice.

This talk will be accessible to graduate students.
