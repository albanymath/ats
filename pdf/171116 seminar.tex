\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The classification of constructible cosheaves as representations of the entrance path category leads to many questions of both a pure and applied flavor. I will begin by considering further examples of the entrance path category as well as its behavior under refining and coarsening of strata, describing some questions along the way. I will then describe how the notion of interleaving for cosheaves leads to further questions and results with relations to geometric measure theory, representation theory, and analysis.

\noindent N.B. This talk will be a continuation of my previous talks, but statements of results will be recalled as necessary.
