\hyphenation{uncountably}

\begin{abstract}
Bestvina and Brady discovered the first groups which were of type FP but not finitely presented. More recently, Ian Leary produced uncountably many groups that are of type FP and even that every countable group embeds in a group of type FP, showing that there is a stark difference between this class and the class of finitely presented groups. I will discuss recent work showing that there are uncountably many QI classes of groups of type FP. This is joint work with Ian Leary and Ignat Soroko.
