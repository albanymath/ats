\title{The Universal $\ell^p$-Metric on Merge Trees}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Adapting a definition given by Bjerkevik and Lesnick for multiparameter persistence modules, we introduce an $\ell^p$-type extension of the interleaving distance on merge trees. We show that our distance is a metric, and that it upper-bounds the $p$-Wasserstein distance between the associated barcodes. For each $p \in [1,\infty]$, we prove that this distance is stable with respect to cellular sublevel filtrations and that it is universal.
