\begin{abstract}
Building on the polynomial web category, we introduce the affine $q$-web category, a diagrammatic monoidal category, along with its cyclotomic quotients. Using the affine $q$-web category as a foundation, we further develop the affine $q$-Schur category. The cyclotomic $q$-Schur categories provide the first diagrammatic presentation of the Dipper--James--Mathas cyclotomic $q$-Schur algebras. Additionally, we establish basis theorems for all these categories. This is joint work with Linliang Song and Weiqiang Wang.
