\noindent\large\textsc{Abstract.}
I will first introduce from scratch Thompson's group~$T$ (along with its important subgroup~$F$), then describe the structure of all its finite subgroups and of their centralizers and normalizers, and finally explain some consequences of these results in algebraic $K$-theory.
This talk is based on joint work with Ross Geoghegan, and is related to but completely independent from last week's seminar.
