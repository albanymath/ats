\begin{abstract}
In this talk we will discuss how Demazure-Lusztig operators can be used to study $p$-adic (Iwahori-)Whittaker functions in both the classical and the metaplectic, finite-dimensional and general Kac-Moody setting. The operators can be used to understand constructions of Whittaker functions in terms of combinatorial devices (such as highest weight crystals) in the finite-dimensional setting. They also provide a tool to extend these constructions to a greater generality. In addition, Weyl symmetrizers built from these operators raise interesting questions related to Macdonald's constant term conjecture.
