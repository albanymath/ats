\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
I will discuss the space ${\mathcal{L}}_{n}$, the nerve of the poset of proper orthogonal decompositions of complex $n$-space. The space ${\mathcal{L}}_{n}$ makes an\linebreak appearance in the orthogonal calculus of M.~Weiss. It has many parallels to the space ${\mathcal{P}}_{n}$, the nerve of the poset of nontrivial, proper partitions of an $n$-element set, which makes an important appearance in the Goodwillie calculus of functors. I will explain recent advances in understanding the $U(n)$-equivariant homotopy type of ${\mathcal{L}}_{n}$.
