\title{Dynamical Systems on Chain Complexes}
\date{Thursday, November 21, 2019}


\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In the first talk of this series of two talks, we will discuss how to introduce
a notion of ``vector field'' and its (discrete time) ``flow'' on any chain complex.
The resulting dynamical systems theory allows to replace the chain complex
with a ``smaller'' one of the same homotopy type. In many cases of interest
this can be accomplished in an explicit, canonical, and symmetry-preserving
manner. In the second talk we will discuss how this theory can be used
to construct minimal free resolutions of monomial ideals and of toric rings, thus
providing a solution to two long-standing open problems in commutative
algebra.
