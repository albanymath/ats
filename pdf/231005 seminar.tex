\begin{abstract}
How multiparameter persistence modules decompose as direct sums of indecomposable modules is well-understood from the perspective of pure representation theory. In topological data analysis, however, this understanding is unsatisfying, as decomposition is wildly unstable with respect to noise.

I will explain why naive attempts to build a theory of decomposition of multiparameter modules that is robust to noise tend to fail, and then present recent work showing that a decomposition stability theorem can be proved despite these difficulties. Finally, I will talk about a conjecture that would strengthen this result in some cases that are relevant for other areas of multipersistence, and (if time allows) how a version of this conjecture can be phrased in an elegant way using just basic graph theory and linear algebra.

The talk is based on the preprint \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15550}{\texttt{arXiv:2305.15550}}.
