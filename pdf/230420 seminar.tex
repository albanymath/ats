\begin{abstract}
(Joint work with A.~Rasmussen and C.~Abbott.) Recent papers of Balasubramanya and Abbott--Rasmussen have classified the hyperbolic actions of several families of classically studied solvable groups. A key tool for these investigations is the machinery of confining subsets of Caprace--Cornulier--Monod--Tessera. This machinery applies in particular to solvable groups with virtually cyclic abelianizations.
