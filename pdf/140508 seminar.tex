\title{The Nilpotent Commutator\\ of a Nilpotent Matrix}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Let $B$ be an $n\times n$ nilpotent matrix with Jordan block sizes given by the partition~$P$ of~$n$.
It is well-known that the nilpotent commutator of~$B$ consisting of all nilpotent matrices that commute with~$B$ is an irreducible variety.
So there is a unique partition~$Q(P)$ that is the Jordan partition of a generic element of the nilpotent commutator of~$B$.
Several authors have studied the partition~$Q(P)$ using different methods.
In this talk we introduce a poset that is associated to the partition~$P$ and show how the combinatorial properties of this poset can be used to explicitly determine the partition~$Q(P)$.
We then report on a current project, joint with Anthony Iarrobino, Bart Van Steirteghem, and Rui Zhao, in which we study the set $Q^{âˆ’1}(Q)$ for a partition~$Q$.
