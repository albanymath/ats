\begin{abstract}
Richard Goldstein (March~18, 1939 -- April~1, 2025) was a professor in our department from 1970 until his retirement in~2018.
Among his contributions to geometric topology and combinatorial group theory, the most influential ones were arguably in a series of articles published in the mid~1980â€™s in \emph{Inventiones Mathematicae} and in the \emph{Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society} (authored jointly with Ted Turner, who also was a professor in our department).
These articles resolve conjectures of John Stallings, about finite generation of certain subgroups of free groups, using 3-dimensional manifold topology.
This talk will be a friendly introduction to these ideas and results.
