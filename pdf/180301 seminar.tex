\begin{abstract}
To an \emph{ADE} Dynkin diagram, one can attach a simply-laced complex simple Lie algebra, say~$\mathfrak{g}$, and a class of Nakajima's quiver varieties.
The latter provides a natural home for a geometric representation theory of the former.
If the algebra~$\mathfrak{g}$ is further equipped with an involution, it leads to a so-called symmetric pair~$(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{k})$, where $\mathfrak{k}$ is the fixed-point subalgebra under involution.
In this talk, Iâ€™ll present bridges at several levels between symmetric pairs and Nakajima varieties.
