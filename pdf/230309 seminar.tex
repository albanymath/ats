\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
I will discuss a new uncountable class of pairwise non-quasi-isometric groups that are two-generated, solvable of derived length 3, left-orderable, and residually finite. In particular, up to my knowledge, this class provides the first example of a quasi-isometrically diverse class of left-orderable groups and, in addition, recovers or strengthens several known results in this direction. To achieve this result, a new quasi-isometric invariant was introduced, which I will discuss as well. The talk will be based on an ongoing project of mine.
