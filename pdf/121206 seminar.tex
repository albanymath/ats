\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this talk, I will give a brief development of the study of smooth embeddings of manifolds from a homotopy-theoretic point of view, and then present some new results in the setting of Poincar\'e Duality spaces. In particular, I will describe a homotopy-theoretic version of smooth embeddings, known as ``Embedded Thickenings'' or ``Poincar\'e Duality Embeddings'', and present theorems, set in the Poincar\'e Duality category, which generalize some smooth results of Frank Connolly and Bruce Williams from the late 1970's.
