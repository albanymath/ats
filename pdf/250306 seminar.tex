\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We will revisit several classical results in the representation theory of semisimple Lie groups and algebras, tracing their origins back to the 1930s and 1960s. Taking a detour through the `chiral' domain,  we’ll make a long  (but scenic!) journey through vertex algebras to extend these results in the setup of infinite-dimensional algebras. Finally, with a clever twist, we’ll find ourselves back in the classical representation theory, though perhaps seeing it with new eyes.
