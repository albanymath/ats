\title{Connectivity of Complexes\\ Related to Homological Stability}
\date{Thursday, September 19, 2019}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
I will discuss canonical complexes of Randal-Williams and Wahl whose connectivity implies homological stability, and I will explain connectivity results obtained in joint work with B.~Schreiner and N.~Wahl. I will explain how this work gives evidence for a conjecture of Randal-Williams and Wahl.
