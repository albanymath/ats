\begin{abstract}
Many questions in consistency analysis have a local to global flavor, which mathematically can be phrased in the language of obstructions to extensions of mappings. In algebraic topology there are several tools which address these kinds of problems, but they need to be made robust to changes in scale if one wants to apply them in the world of data. In this talk we will present some preliminary results in this direction.
