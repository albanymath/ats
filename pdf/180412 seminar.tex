\title{What Is\ldots\ the Whitehead Group?}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Given a group~$G$ (finite or infinite, abelian or not), its Whitehead group~$\mathit{Wh}(G)$ is an abelian group defined using only elementary linear algebra. Remarkably, as I will review, Whitehead groups play a major role in the classification of high-dimensional manifolds. But, unfortunately, Whitehead groups are hard to compute. I will survey what is known and what is conjectured to be true about the structure of Whitehead groups, and then present some recent results.
