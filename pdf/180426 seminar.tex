\title{Operads with Homological Stability}
\date{Thursday, April 26, 2018}

\begin{abstract}
For a carefully constructed operad~$M$ of surfaces, Tillmann showed that algebras over~$M$ group complete to infinite loop spaces. This result relies, in part, on Harer's homological stability theorem for mapping class groups of surfaces. We will review Tillmann's result and provide a more general framework which shows that operads satisfying a certain homological stability condition detect infinite loop spaces. This is joint work with M.~Basterra, I.~Bobkova, K.~Ponto, and U.~Tillmann.
