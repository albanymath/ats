\title{On the Adams Isomorphism for Equivariant Orthogonal Spectra --- Part 3}
\date{Thursday, October 3, 2013}


\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This series of talks has two goals.
The first one is to present a reasonably self-contained introduction to equivariant orthogonal spectra, a modern framework for equivariant stable homotopy theory.
The second one is to report on joint work with Holger Reich, in which we give a natural construction and a direct proof of the Adams isomorphism for equivariant orthogonal spectra.
In particular I will define and explain all the technical terms used in the following paragraph, which is a more detailed abstract for the last talk of the series.
\begin{quote}
``For any finite group~$G$, any normal subgroup $N$ of~$G$, and any orthogonal $G$-spectrum~$X$, we construct a natural map $A$ of orthogonal $G/N$-spectra from the homotopy $N$-orbits of~$X$ to the derived $N$-fixed points of~$X$, and we show that $A$ is a stable weak equivalence if $X$ is $N$-free.  This recovers a theorem of Lewis, May, and Steinberger in the equivariant stable homotopy category, which in the case of suspension spectra was originally proved by Adams.  We emphasize that our `Adams map' $A$ is natural even before passing to the homotopy category.  One of the main tools we develop is a fibrant replacement construction with good functorial properties, which we believe is of independent interest.''
