\begin{abstract}
We will show that for every ring~$R$ the assembly map in algebraic $K$-theory
\[H_n^G(\underbar EG;\mathbb K_R)\to K_n(R[G])\]
is split injective for every subgroup~$G$ of a linear group which admits a finite dimensional model for the classifying space~$\underbar EG$ for proper actions.
For this we will use the concept of finite decomposition complexity, first introduced by Guentner, Tessera, and Yu.
It is a coarse invariant of metric spaces and generalizes the notion of finite asymptotic dimension.
