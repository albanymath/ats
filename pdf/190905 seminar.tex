\begin{abstract}
Just as Gromov hyperbolic groups arose as a generalization of fundamental groups of closed hyperbolic manifolds, relatively hyperbolic groups are meant to generalize finite volume hyperbolic manifolds. In the cocompact case, Schwarz--Milnor provides canonical structure to the group. However, in the case of a non-cocompact action, more care must be taken to recover geometric information from the space itself and its boundary. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions to assign a well defined QI type of space and quasi-symmetry type of boundary to a relatively hyperbolic pair.
