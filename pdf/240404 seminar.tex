\begin{abstract}
In this seminar, I will present the article “Abelian and model structures on tame functors” \href{http://www.arxiv.org/abs/2301.04079/}{\texttt{[arXiv:2301.04079]}}, by Wojciech \mbox{Chachólski}, Claudia Landi, Francesca Tombari, and myself. I will discuss certain\linebreak circumstances in which the category of tame functors inherits an abelian category structure with minimal resolutions and a model category structure with minimal cofibrant replacements, with some examples realizing these\linebreak circumstances. Moreover, with some additional hypothesis,  I will also show a structure theorem for cofibrant objects. If time permits, I will conclude with a general technique to generate indecomposable objects in the abelian category of functors indexed by finite posets.

Disclaimer: while the original motivation comes from applied topology, this talk will be quite theoretical.
