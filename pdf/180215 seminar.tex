\title{Tree Almost Automorphism Groups: Elements and Subgroups}

\begin{abstract}
(Joint work with A.\ Le Boudec.) We begin by giving a detailed overview of the tree almost automorphism groups, which are rather exotic locally compact groups. In particular, we describe their relationship to the Higman-Thompson groups. We then discuss several structure results for elements and subgroups. For example, each almost automorphism comes in exactly one of two types, analogous to the elliptic or hyperbolic dichotomy for the classical case of tree automorphisms.  As applications, we recover a result for Thompson's group~$V$ as well as a new observation about the RÃ¶ver group.
