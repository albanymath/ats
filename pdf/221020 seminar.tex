\title{Invariants in the Cohomology of the Complement of a Reflection Arrangement}

\begin{abstract}
Let $G$ be a finite group of linear transformations of a finite dimensional complex vector space~$V$ generated by reflections and let~$M$ be the subset of~$V$ consisting of vectors that are not fixed by any of the reflections in~$G$. Then~$G$ acts on~$M$, hence on the singular cohomology of~$M$, and one can ask about the character of this graded representation. In this talk I will report on joint work with Goetz Pfeiffer and Gerhard Roehrle in which we explicitly compute the space of $G$-invariants. A surprising, and unexplained, consequence of the calculations is that the Poincar√© polynomial of the space of invariants fits one of just four simple patterns.
