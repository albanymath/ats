\title{Resolutions of the\\ $K(2)$-Local Sphere Spectrum}
\date{Thursday, December 4, 2014}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Computing the stable homotopy groups of spheres is a long-standing problem in algebraic topology. I will begin by introducing the subject of chromatic homotopy theory which describes the homotopy of the $p$-local sphere spectrum~$S$ through a family of localizations $L_{K(n)}S$ with respect to Morava K-theories~$K(n)$. I will discuss computational tools which arise from the the theory of formal group laws and their deformations. Then I will specialize to the $K(2)$-local category and talk about finite resolutions of the $K(2)$-local sphere spectrum by a sequence of spectra and some recent computations.
