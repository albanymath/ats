\begin{abstract}
Sage is a free, open-source mathematical software that supports research and teaching in algebra, number theory, combinatorics, geometry, analysis, numerical computation, and many related areas.
Sage is powerful, easy to use, well documented, and actively developed.

In this tutorial I will show with many examples how to start using Sage.
No familiarity with any math software nor programming (nor any interest in algebra/topology) will be assumed.
