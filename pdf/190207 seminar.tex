\begin{abstract}
Genuine equivariant commutative ring spectra have played an active role in algebraic topology in recent years, and have been central to several celebrated results. There is now a current interest to enhance the notion of an equivariant symmetric monoidal category to match this rich structure. In this talk, I will describe joint work with Luis Pereira providing a new model for such an object. Motivating examples include Mackey functors (of abelian groups) and the norm construction in equivariant ring spectra, as well as all known examples from other models. I will introduce this construction as well as some applications, including an equivariant Barratt--Priddy--Quillen Theorem.
