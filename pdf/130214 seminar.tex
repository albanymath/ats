\title{``Good'' Posets and LCM-Lattices of~Monomial Ideals}
\date{Thursday, February 14, 2013}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In my talk two weeks ago I discussed a class of posets that can be used to construct the minimal free resolution of any monomial ideal.  In this talk I will explain how such ``good'' posets can arise from the LCM-lattice of a monomial ideal. This talk will be self contained, and will not use in any essential way (except for motivation) my previous talk. This is joint work with Tim Clark.
