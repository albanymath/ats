\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This is joint work with G.~Garkusha. In the talk I will discuss the construction of fibrant replacements for spectra consisting of Thom spaces (suspension spectra of varieties and algebraic cobordism~$\mathit{MGL}$ being the motivating examples) that uses the theory of framed correspondences. As a consequence we get a description of the infinite loop space of~$\mathit{MGL}$ in terms of Hilbert schemes.
