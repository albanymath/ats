\title{Cannon--Thurston Maps\\ in Non-positive Curvature}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Two far-reaching methods for studying the geometry of a finitely generated group with non-positive curvature are (1)~to study the structure of the boundaries of the group, and (2)~to study the structure of its finitely generated subgroups. Cannon--Thurston maps, named after foundational work of Cannon and Thurston in the setting of fibered hyperbolic 3-manifolds, allow one to combine these approaches. Mitra (Mj) generalized work of Cannon and Thurston to prove the existence of Cannon--Thurston maps for any normal hyperbolic subgroup of a hyperbolic group. I will explain why a similar theorem fails for certain CAT(0) groups. This is joint work with Beeker--Cordes--Gardham--Gupta.
