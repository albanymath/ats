\title{$K$-Theoretic Stable Bases\\ and Hecke Algebras}
\date{Thursday, April 5, 2018}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
By using the twisted group algebra of Kostant and Kumar, I will give an algebraic definition of $K$-theoretic stable bases originally defined by Maulik and Okounkov. Then I will talk about the formal root polynomial method, which is used to compute the restriction formula of stable bases. This is joint work with Changjian Su and Gufang Zhao.
