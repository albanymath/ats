\begin{abstract}
Let $N$ be a smooth manifold that his homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to a hyperbolic manifold~$M$. How much symmetry does $N$ have? In particular, does $\operatorname{Isom}(M)$ act on~$N$ by diffeomorphisms? Farrell-Jones showed that in general the answer is ``No''; however, for their examples, it is still possible for the orientation-preserving subgroup to act on~$N$. In this talk, we will discuss this problem and its relation to Nielsen realization. We give examples of~$N$ such that $\operatorname{Isom}(M)$ does act on~$N$, as well as examples where the largest subgroup of $\operatorname{Isom}(M)$ that acts on~$N$ has arbitrarily large index. This is ongoing joint work with Mauricio Bustamante.
