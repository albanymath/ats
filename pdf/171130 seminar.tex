\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The free Lie algebra is a natural mathematical construction that is central in algebraic combinatorics and has applications in other fields.  I~will discuss a generalization of the free Lie algebra based on an $n$-ary commutator. The action of the symmetric group on its multilinear component generalizes the well-known representation $Lie(\Bbbk)$. I will discuss results and conjectures about this generalization of $Lie(\Bbbk)$, including a representation whose dimension is the Catalan number.
