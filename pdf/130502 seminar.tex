\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The idea of CW-complexes over categories plays an important role in joint work with Alex Tchernev on minimal free resolutions of monomial ideals.
I will introduce this concept and illustrate it with some examples and applications --- some in equivariant topology, and some in the special case of posets and in particular closure posets of cell complexes.
