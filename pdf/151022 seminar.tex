\title{Formal Affine Demazure Algebra\\ and Its Dual --- Part 1}
\date{Thursday, October 22, 2015}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
I will recall the notions of oriented cohomology and of equivariant cohomology. Then I will recall Kostant-Kumar's work on the algebraic construction of equivariant singular cohomology and equivariant Grothen\-dieck group of complete flag varieties.
They defined the so-called nil-Hecke algebra and $0$-Hecke algebra.
I will also introduce the formal group algebra which is the algebraic replacement of $T$-equivariant cohomology of a point.
I~will also define the formal affine Demazure algebra.
