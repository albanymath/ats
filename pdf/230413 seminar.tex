\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Labeled configuration spaces of a manifold with labels in a pointed space were introduced by McDuff and Segal as a generalization of unordered configuration spaces. More recently, Knudsen identified labeled configuration spaces with the topological Quillen objects of certain spectral Lie algebras and used a bar spectral sequence to provide a general formula for their Betti numbers. The bar spectral sequence for their mod~$p$ homology is much less tractable due to the existence of power operations. I will explain how to compute the $E^2$-page and extract information at low weights.
