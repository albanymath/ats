\title{A Tale of Two(?) Towers}
\date{Thursday, March 27, 2014}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Goodwillie's calculus of homotopy functors provides a way to approximate a homotopy functor of spaces with a sequence of functors, called a Taylor tower, satisfying certain excision conditions.
In this talk, I will describe the basic properties of this tower, and a related ``discrete'' Taylor tower that arises in algebraic contexts.
I will show how these towers are related to classical constructions such as stable homotopy theory and Andr\'e-Quillen homology, and discuss recent work determining the extent to which these towers are the same.
