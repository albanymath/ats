\title{An Example of Liftings with Different Hodge Numbers}
\date{Thursday, November 15, 2018}


\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Does a smooth proper variety in positive characteristic know the Hodge number of its liftings? The answer is ``of course not.'' However, it's not that easy to come up with a counterexample. In this talk, I will first introduce the background of this problem. Then I shall discuss some obvious constraints of constructing a counterexample. Lastly I will present such a counterexample and state a few questions of similar flavor for which I do not know an answer.
