\title{Finiteness Properties of\\ Nekrashevych Groups}
\date{Thursday, October 12, 2017}

\begin{abstract}
Given a self-similar group~$G$ acting on a regular rooted $d$-ary tree, we
consider the subgroup~$V_d(G)$ of almost automorphisms of the tree that
``locally look like''~$G$. This forms a Nekrashevych group and provides a
natural way of joining the Higman-Thompson group~$V_d$ with the self-similar
group~$G$.

\hspace{-.25em}In this talk, we discuss finiteness properties of certain Nekrashevych
groups. This work follows and expands on work of Belk and Matucci who
considered the RÃ¶ver group, $V_2(G)$, where $G$ is the Grigorchuk Group.
This is a joint work with Matt Zaremsky.
