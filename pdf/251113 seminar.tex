\begin{abstract}
We give geometric conditions which imply that the space obtained by coning off the boundary components of a hyperbolic manifold~$M$ is negatively curved. Moreover, we give explicit geometric conditions under which a locally convex subset of~$M$ gives rise to a locally convex subset of the cone-off. Group-theoretically, we conclude that the fundamental group of the cone-off is hyperbolic of cohomological dimension~$n$ and the $\pi_1$-image of the coned-off locally convex subset is a quasi-convex subgroup. This is joint work with Jason Manning.
