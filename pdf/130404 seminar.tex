\begin{abstract}
Having previously defined the Conley index of an isolated invariant set, I will give a brief outline of how to define intersection pairings on the tensor product of the homology modules of foward and reverse time Conley indices. A space of isolated invariant sets over the space of smooth vectorfields on a manifold will be defined and continuation isomorphisms between the Conley indices at the endpoints of a path of isolated invariant sets defined. Intersection pairings on Conley indices are invariant under such continuation isomorphisms. Applications to two-point boundary value problems will be discussed as time allows.
