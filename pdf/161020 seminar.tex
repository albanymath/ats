\begin{abstract}
Let $X = G/P$ be a flag variety with the action of a torus $T = (\mathbb{C}^{\ast})^n$.  Its $T$-equivariant quantum $K$-theory ring is a deformation of the Grothendieck ring of $T$-equivariant coherent sheaves on~$X$.  We will present a brief overview of these rings before we discuss three curious properties of the equivariant quantum $K$-theory ring for $X$ cominuscule.  These properties relate the ring structure to sheaf Euler characteristics and to the geometry of rational curves in~$X$.  This is joint work with Anders Buch.
