\begin{abstract}
A complete local ring of embedding codepth~$3$ has a minimal free
resolution of length~$3$ over a regular local ring.
Such resolutions carry a differential graded algebra structure, based on which one can classify local rings of embedding codepth~$3$.
The Gorenstein rings of embedding codepth~$3$ belong to the class called~$\mathbf{G}(r)$, which was conjectured not to contain any non Gorenstein rings.
For any $r\geq 2$ we construct non Gorenstein rings in~$\mathbf{G}(r)$, starting from Gorenstein rings of embedding codepth~$3$.
