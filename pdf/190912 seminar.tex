\title{Connectivity of Complexes\\ Related to Homological Stability}
\date{Thursday, September 12, 2019}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
I will describe joint work with Bridget Schreiner and Nathalie Wahl, in which we investigate the connectivity of certain simplicial complexes related to homological stability. As a tool, we introduce a new ``doubling'' construction for simplicial complexes and show that, given a weak Cohen--Macauley bound for a simplicial complex, it is possible to obtain a weak Cohen--Macauley bound for its double.
