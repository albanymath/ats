\begin{abstract}
A sequence of groups $G_1 \to G_2 \to \cdots$ exhibits \emph{homological stability} if the induced maps on homology $H_i(G_n) \to H_i(G_{n+1})$ are isomorphisms for $n$ large relative to~$i$.
In this talk, we explore an axiomatization due to Oscar Randal-Williams and Nathalie Wahl of conditions on the groups~$G_n$ that imply homological stability, and show how this applies to classical groups of interest. We then explain Quillen’s spectral sequence argument and how it gives a proof of homological stability in the Randal-Williams--Wahl setup.
