\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The Macdonald polynomials are a remarkable family of orthogonal polynomials introduced by Macdonald in 1988.  These polynomials have important connections to representation theory and the geometry of certain algebraic varieties. In this talk, I will establish the connection between two combinatorial formulas for the non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials --- the Ram-Yip and Haglund-Haiman-Loehr formulas.
