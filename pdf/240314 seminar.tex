\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Regular trees of graphs are inverse limits of particularly simple inverse systems of finite graphs.  They form a $1$-dimensional subclass of the Markov compacta: a class of finitely describable inverse limits of simplicial complexes, which includes all boundaries of hyperbolic groups.  I will discuss upcoming joint work with Jacek Świątkowski in which we use Bowditch’s canonical JSJ decomposition to characterize the $1$-ended hyperbolic groups whose boundaries are (regular) trees of graphs.
