\begin{abstract}
We explore the implementation of higher categories of interest using Verityâ€™s complicial sets. In this model, higher categories are encoded as simplicial sets where $k$-simplices represent $k$-morphisms and marked $k$-simplices indicate equivalences. To illustrate the formalism, we review a construction of the $(\infty,2)$-category of rings and bimodules as a $2$-complicial set, and discuss ongoing work toward defining an $(\infty,\infty)$-category of manifolds and cobordisms within this framework. Some of the constructions I will present are joint and ongoing work with Dutta--Luneia--Silver--Zapata Castro in various combinations.
