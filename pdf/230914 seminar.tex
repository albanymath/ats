\begin{abstract}
The right-angled Artin group (RAAG) on a graph is the group generated by the vertices, and in which two generators commute if and only if the corresponding vertices are adjacent. Vice versa, when one is given a group in which all relators are commutators, it is natural to ask if it is secretly isomorphic to the RAAG on some graph. Bridson has shown that this “RAAG-recognition problem” is in general undecidable.

In this talk I will consider the problem for the class of Bestvina--Brady groups (BBGs). Every RAAG is a BBG, and I will describe a criterion to certify when a BBG is not a RAAG. This is based on a description of the BNS-invariant of a BBG, and provides a complete solution to the RAAG-recognition problem in dimension~$2$. This is joint work with Y.-C.~Chang.
