\title{Local Condition Sets\\ for Demazure Tableaux}

\begin{abstract}
In a Lie theoretic setting, choosing a dominant weight~$\lambda$ and a Weyl group element~$w$ determines a Demazure module.
This module yields a Demazure character obtained by summing formal exponentials over its set of weights.
In type~A, this character can be produced via the weights of a certain set of semistandard tableaux, called Demazure tableaux, using the notion of ``right keys'' introduced by Lascoux and Sch\"utzenberger.
In this talk we will present a new method to compute the right key of a semistandard tableau.
We will then use it to provide ``local conditions'' for each value in a given Demazure tableau, analogous to those of semistandard tableaux.
If time allows we will discuss further applications such as Demazure atoms, convex polytopes, and connections to Flag-Schur functions.
