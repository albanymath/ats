\title{Centralizers and a Universal Space with Cyclic Isotropy of Thompson's Group~\texorpdfstring{$F$}{F}}

\begin{abstract}
I'll present new joint work with Matt Zaremsky.
We describe a universal space with cyclic isotropy for Thompson's group~$F$ of orientation preserving, piecewise linear, dyadic homeomorphisms of the unit interval.
A~key ingredient is the analysis of centralizers and normalizers of cyclic subgroups of~$F$, which is of independent interest.
We finally give applications to assembly maps and isomorphism conjectures.
