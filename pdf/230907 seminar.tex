\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The quantum $K$-theory ring of a smooth projective variety is a deformation of its $K$-theory ring of algebraic vector bundles. Gu, Mihalcea, Sharpe, and Zou gave a presentation for the (equivariant) quantum $K$-theory ring of the Grassmannian, where the relations are deformations of the classical $K$-theoretic Whitney relations. We conjecture a generalization of these quantum $K$ Whitney relations to all partial flag manifolds. If these relations hold, then they give a complete set of relations. We prove this conjecture for the incidence variety $\operatorname{Fl}(1,n-1;n)$, and for the full flag manifold, we reduce this conjecture to a conjecture of Buch and Mihalcea on Chevalley-type $K$-theoretic Gromov--Witten invariants. This is joint with Gu, Mihalcea, Sharpe, Zhang, and Zou.
