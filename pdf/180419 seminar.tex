\title{Higher Torsion Invariants and\\ Secondary Transfer of Smooth Bundles}
\date{Thursday, April 19, 2018}


\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Higher torsion invariants are invariants of bundles of smooth manifolds that can distinguish between bundles that are not diffeomorphic even if they are fiberwise homotopy equivalent. In recent years different approaches to the construction of higher torsion have been developed. The talk will describe a construction of higher torsion by means of the secondary transfer of bundles. I will also explain how this approach to higher torsion provides an insight into some of its properties. This is joint work with Wojciech Dorabia≈Ça.
