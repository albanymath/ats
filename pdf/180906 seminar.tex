\title{Acyclicity of Schur Complexes}
\date{Thursday, September 6, 2018}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Schur modules are important objects of study in characteristic-free representation theory. Schur complexes were introduced by Akin, Buchsbaum, and Weyman in 1982 as a useful tool for the study of Schur modules. In this joint work with Muberra Allahverdi, who graduated in May 2017, we build on the results in her University at Albany Ph.D.\ thesis, and we describe a necessary and sufficient condition for the acyclicity of any given Schur complex. If time permits, we will also discuss some useful applications.
