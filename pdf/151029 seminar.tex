\title{Formal Affine Demazure Algebra\\ and Its Dual --- Part 2}
\date{Thursday, October 29, 2015}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
I will introduce the dual of the formal affine Demazure algebra, and some of its properties.
For instance, I will introduce the equivariant characteristic map and the Borel isomorphism.
I will also mention the generalized GKM-model.
I will give the construction of cohomology of partial flag varieties, and define a resolution of the dual of the formal affine Demazure algebra.
