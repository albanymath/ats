\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Thompson’s group~$F$ is, in some sense, as far from being a hyperbolic group as possible. In joint work with Sahana Balasubramanya and Francesco Fournier-Facio, we prove that $F$ nonetheless admits a tremendous number of different actions on hyperbolic spaces. This is in contrast to the other classical Thompson’s groups, $T$ and~$V$, which admit no interesting actions whatsoever on hyperbolic spaces.
