\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this talk we will outline the proof of homological stability for scissors automorphism groups and highlight a number of consequences and related results. These include plus and group completion constructions for assembler $K$-theory, interpreting higher $K$-theory in terms of automorphism groups, and homology calculations for some scissors automorphism groups. The content of the talk is joint work with Kupers, Malkiewich, Miller, and Sroka.
