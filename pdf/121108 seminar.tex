\begin{abstract}
Braid groups arise as fundamental groups of configuration spaces of points in the plane, and from the same geometric picture, as automorphisms of free groups.  A higher dimensional analog, the configuration space of unlinked circles in~$\mathbb R^3$, was studied in the thesis of Dahm~(1962) and in a paper of Brendle and Hatcher~(2002).  In this talk I'll briefly summarize these results and introduce analogous work on the space of linearly embedded tetrahedral graphs in~$\mathbb R^3$.  Some interesting generalizations will be discussed.
