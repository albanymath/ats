\begin{abstract}
We introduce a family of dual filtered graded graphs $(\Gamma_s, \Gamma_w)$ for an arbitrary Kac–Moody algebra $g$. These dual filtered graded graphs have the Weyl group $W$ of $g$ as their vertex set. The edges of graph $\Gamma_s$ are labeled versions of the $\lambda$-chain model of K-Chevalley rules for Kac–Moody flag manifolds as developed by Lenart and Shimozono, originally defined by Lenart and Postnikov. Meanwhile, the labels on $\Gamma_w$ come from the dual multiplication map of K-homology of affine Grassmannian $Gr_G$. In the limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ of the $A^{(1)}_{n-1}$, our construction recovers the Möbius construction of the dual filtered graph, as previously studied by Patrias and Pylyavskyy. We also expect to recover their combinatorics of Möbius deformation of the shifted Young’s lattice in type $C^{(1)}_n$ as $n$ approaches infinity. This research is conducted jointly with Mark Shimozono.
