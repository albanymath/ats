\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
I will survey the homotopical approach to eliminating fixed points of equivariant maps between manifolds, as developed by Klein and Williams. I will then discuss joint work with Sarah Yeakel, in which we study obstructions to eliminating fixed points of isovariant maps (equivariant maps which preserve isotropy groups).
