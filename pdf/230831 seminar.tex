\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Symmetries of a group G are encoded in the automorphism group $\operatorname{Aut}(G)$. ``Hidden symmetries'' are encoded in the abstract commensurator $\operatorname{Comm}(G)$. Abstract commensurator groups may reflect the structure of G in an interesting way. For example, $\operatorname{Comm}(G)$ is typically a group of matrices with rational entries when G is arithmetic, and the abstract commensurators of many self-similar groups such as the Grigorchuk group contain Thompson's group V. However, the abstract commensurator of a free group $\operatorname{Comm}(F_2)$ is still not well understood. I will explain how Edgar A.\ Bering~IV and I showed that every countable locally finite group is a subgroup of $\operatorname{Comm}(F_2)$, providing a generally useful topological perspective along the way.
