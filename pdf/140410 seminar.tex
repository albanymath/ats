\title{Words within Words\\ A Recursive Approach to the\\ Catalan Numbers and Fine Numbers}
\date{Thursday, April 10, 2014}

\begin{abstract}
In this talk, I present a new recursive formula for the Catalan numbers.
The proof uses Dyck Words, one of the many objects that are known to be counted by the Catalan numbers.
It is well-known that the number of Dyck words of length~$2n$ is given by~$C_n$, the $n$-th Catalan number.
We obtain our recursion by ``factoring'' Dyck words into smaller Dyck words which appear inside them.
We also present a second proof using generating functions.
The generating function approach can be modified to yield a new formula that expresses the $n$-th Fine number in terms of the Catalan numbers.
