\begin{abstract}
Large-scale homology computations are often rendered tractable by discrete Morse theory. Every discrete Morse function on a given cell complex~$X$ produces a Morse chain complex whose chain groups are spanned by critical cells and whose homology is isomorphic to that of~$X$. However, the space-level information is typically lost because very little is known about how critical cells are attached to each other. In this talk, we discretize a beautiful construction of Cohen, Jones and Segal in order to completely recover the homotopy type of~$X$ from an overlaid discrete Morse function.
