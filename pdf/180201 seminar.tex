\title{Subgroups and Supergroups of~Thompson's~Group~$V$}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Thompson's group~$V$ was the first example of a finitely presentable infinite simple group.  It can be characterized as a group acting on infinite sequences over a finite alphabet by finite prefix exchanges.  These finite prefix exchanges can be illustrated using finite state automata and tree pair diagrams.

One can form subgroups and supergroups of~$V$ by restricting or augmenting the finite prefix exchanges.   I will talk about when these subgroups and supergroups are isomorphic to Thompson's group~$V$.
