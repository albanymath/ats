\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We will discuss recent results on the structure of the outer automorphism group of a right-angled Coxeter group (RACG), comparing these with known results for the mapping class group, $\operatorname{Out}(F_n)$, and outer automorphism groups of right-angled Artin groups (RAAGs). We will show that outer automorphism groups of RACGs are either large or virtually abelian, and give a condition on the definite graph that distinguishes these cases. As a consequence, this implies that $\operatorname{Out}$ of a RACG has property (T) if and only if it is finite. This is joint work with Andrew Sale.
