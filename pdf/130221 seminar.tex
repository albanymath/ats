\begin{abstract}
If $Y$ is a complex manifold with $H^i (Y, \Omega^j_Y)=0$ for all $j\geq 0$ and $i>0$, then what is $Y$? Is Y Stein? This is a question raised by J.-P. Serre in 1953. Here $\Omega^j_Y$ is the sheaf of holomorphic $j$-forms and the cohomology is ${\check{\mbox{C}}}$ech cohomology. Serre's question is open even for a surface.  If $Y$ is an algebraic manifold (i.e., an irreducible nonsingular algebraic variety defined over $\mathbb{C}$) of dimension $d\geq 1$ with $H^i(Y, \Omega^j_Y)=0$ for all $j\geq 0$, $i>0$, where $\Omega^j_Y$~is the sheaf of regular $j$-forms on $Y$ and $\Omega^0_Y= {\mathcal{O}}_Y$, then by Serre duality, we immediately see that $Y$ is not complete. Let $X$ be a smooth completion of $Y$ such that the boundary $X-Y$ is the support of an effective divisor $D$ on $X$. We may assume that $D$ is a divisor with simple normal crossings by blowing up the closed subset on the boundary $X-Y$ if it is necessary. We show that the Iitaka $D$-dimension $\kappa(D, X)\neq d-1$, where $\kappa(D, X)$ is the number of algebraically independent nonconstant rational functions on~$X$ with poles in $X-Y$. If $d$ is even, then $\kappa(D, X)$ can be any even number between 0 and $d$. If $d$ is odd, then $\kappa(D, X)$ can be any odd number between 1 and $d$. Moreover, if $\kappa(D,X)= d-2$, then the Kodaira dimension of $X$ is~$-\infty$ and if $d>2$, then $q=h^1(X, {\mathcal{O}}_X)$ can be any positive integer.
