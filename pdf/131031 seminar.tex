\title{Tricks and Treats\\ in Vertex Algebra Theory --- Part 1}
\date{Thursday, October 31, 2013}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This is a series of two talks.
In the first talk I'll discuss several important categorical concepts in vertex algebra theory (e.g., the tensor product theory for modules).
As a treat, I'll present a few interesting applications of vertex algebras to combinatorics and number theory.
