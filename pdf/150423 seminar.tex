\title{The Sigma-invariants of Thompson group F}
\date{Thursday, April 23, 2015}


\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The Sigma-invariants of a group~$G$ determine, for a normal subgroup~$N$ of~$G$ with $G/N$ abelian, whether it is finitely generated and whether it is finitely presented. I will speak about a topological proof of the Sigma-invariants of Thompson's group~$F$. The talk is based on joint work with Matt Zaremsky.
