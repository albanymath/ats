\begin{abstract}
Classically, the Bass–Heller–Swan decomposition relates the \mbox{algebraic} $K$-theory of a Laurent polynomial ring to the algebraic $K$-theory of its coefficient ring. In this talk, I will explain how to obtain a generalisation of this result in the setting of localising invariants of stable infinity-categories that come with an automorphism. As an application, one gets a splitting result for Waldhausen’s $A$-theory of mapping tori. This is joint work with Christian Kremer.
