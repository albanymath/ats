\begin{abstract}
We study units in group rings~$RG$ of finite abelian groups~$G$ with coefficients in rings~$R$ of algebraic integers in number fields.
Let~$\Sigma$ be the sum of all the elements of~$G$ in the group ring~$RG$.
Units of the form $ug$ in~$RG$ (or $ug+(\Sigma)$ in~$RG/(\Sigma)$, respectively) for $u\in R^\times$ and~$g\in G$ are called trivial units.
Units in~$RG$ that project to trivial units in~$RG/(\Sigma)$ are called almost trivial units.
Higman in~1939 classified all finite groups~$G$ for which $\mathbb{Z}G$ contains only trivial units, and Herman and Li in~2005 generalized his results to coefficients in rings of algebraic integers.
We characterize all finite abelian groups~$G$ and rings of algebraic integers~$R$ such that the only units of the reduced group ring~$RG/(\Sigma)$ are trivial units (and so all units of the group ring~$RG$ are almost trivial units).
This is joint work with Anupam Srivastav, which extends the results of Brian Rich’s and my Ph.D.\ theses under Srivastav’s supervision.
