\begin{abstract}
A knot is an embedding of $S^1$, which can be thought of as a piece of string that has been tied up and then had the ends glued together. Given two knots, a ribbon cobordism is a particularly nice surface with boundary the disjoint union of the two knots. Much work has been done to study these surfaces in the smooth topological setting. However, what happens when we add some geometric conditions and study knots and surfaces in a contact or symplectic manifold? It has long been known that every smooth knot has a Legendrian representative (knot which satisfies some extra geometric conditions). In this talk we will discuss why an analogous statement is true for ribbon cobordisms. In particular, if $C$ is a ribbon cobordism in $[0,1]\times S^3$ from the link $K_0$ to $K_1$, then there are Legendrian realizations $\Lambda_0$ and $\Lambda_1$ of $K_0$ and $K_1$, respectively, such that $C$ may be isotoped to a decomposable Lagrangian cobordism from $\Lambda_0$ to $\Lambda_1$. Along the way we will give a brief introduction to Legendrian knots and Lagrangian cobordisms. This is joint work with John Etnyre.
