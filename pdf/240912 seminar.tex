\begin{abstract}
A special class of inner amenable groups are those which are stable in the sense of Jones and Schmidt. For stable groups, there always exists an action that gives rise to a cross product von Neumann algebra which is a McDuff II$_1$ factor, i.e., $M \cong M \otimes \mathcal{R},$ where $\mathcal{R}$ is the hyperfinite II$_1$ factor. Following the work of Bashwinger and Zaremsky, we show that a certain class of groups arising from the Thompson-like group construction of Skipper, Witzel, and Zaremsky are stable groups, providing new examples of McDuff von Neumann algebras. Time permitting, I will discuss other von Neumann algebraic properties of the Thompson group~$V$. This is joint work with Rolando de Santiago and Krishnendu Khan.
