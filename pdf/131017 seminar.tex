\begin{abstract}
Graded modules over graded rings arise naturally in the study of projective algebraic varieties.
In this work in progress, joint with \textsc{Marco Varisco}, we associate to each such module~$M$ a small category~$\mathcal{B}(M)$, called the \emph{Betti category} of M, which captures the essence of the homological properties of~$M$.
For modules of classical interest such as monomial or toric ideals, or the maximal ideal of a toric ring, we show that the isomorphism class of the Betti category~$\mathcal{B}(M)$ determines the structure of the minimal resolution of~$M$.
More precisely, if $M'$ and~$M''$ are graded modules within those classes (over graded rings $R'$ and~$R''$, respectively) and have isomorphic Betti categories, then the minimal free resolution of~$M''$ over~$R''$ can be obtained by applying a canonical functor to the minimal free resolution of~$M'$ over~$R'$.
