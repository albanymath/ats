\title{Convolution Products and Equivariant K-Theory of Flag Varieties}

\begin{abstract}
The main goal of this talk will be to describe how the connection between Demazure/push-pull operators on the $T$-equivariant $K$-theory of the flag variety of a complex, reductive, algebraic group~$G$, and the natural convolution product on the $G$-equivariant $K$-theory of two copies of the same flag variety can be exploited to give a geometric construction of a coproduct in $T$-equivariant $K$-theory defined by Kostant and Kumar. This coproduct is a key ingredient used to described structure constants in $T$-equivariant $K$-theory, $T$-equivariant cohomology, and eventually the singular cohomology of flag varieties.
