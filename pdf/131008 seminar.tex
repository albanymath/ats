\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The extended $W$-algebra of type~$\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at positive rational level is a vertex operator algebra that is of great interest in logarithmic conformal field theory.
In this talk I will give an overview of how it is constructed as a subvertex operator algebra of a lattice vertex operator algebra by means of so called screening operators and symmetric Jack polynomials.
I will also explain how the screening operator formalism allows one to prove~$c_2$ cofiniteness, compute relations in Zhu's algebra, and classify all simple modules of the extended $W$-algebra of type~$\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at positive rational level.
