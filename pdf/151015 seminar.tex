\title{Torsion of Chow Groups\\ of Twisted Flag Varieties}
\date{Thursday, October 15, 2015}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
I will recall the notion of twisted flag varieties.
For linear algebraic groups of type $A_n$ or~$C_n$, such varieties have torsion free Chow groups.
For algebraic groups of type $B_n$ or~$D_n$, it is already known that the torsion part of Chow groups of flag varieties are killed by certain powers of~$2$.
I give an upper bound of the annihilator of the torsion part of Chow groups of such varieties.
This upper bound does not depend on the rank~$n$.
