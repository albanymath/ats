\title{Symmetric Powers of Modules\\ of Low Projective Dimension}
\date{Thursday, August 29, 2013}


\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Symmetric and exterior powers of modules arise in many areas of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, and their torsion properties are key to understanding the properties of related geometric objects.
We will discuss how one can obtain explicit and easy to verify necessary and sufficient conditions that characterize torsion freeness for symmetric powers of finitely generated modules of projective dimension~1 over a commutative Noetherian ring.
This talk will be essentially self-contained.
