\begin{abstract}
In this talk, we study the geometric decomposition of the \mbox{degree-$0$} Persistent Homology Transform (PHT) viewed as a persistence diagram bundle. We focus on star-shaped objects as they can be segmented into smaller, simpler regions known as “sectors”. Algebraically, we demonstrate that the degree-$0$ persistence diagram of a star-shaped object in~$\mathbb{R}^2$ can be derived from the degree-$0$ persistence diagrams of its sectors. Using this, we then establish sufficient conditions for star-shaped objects in~$\mathbb{R}^2$ so that they have “trivial geometric monodromy”. Consequently, the PHT of such a shape can be decomposed as a union of curves parameterized by~$S^1$, where the curves are given by the continuous movement of each point in the persistence diagrams that are parameterized by~$S^1$. Finally, we discuss the current challenges of generalizing these results to higher dimensions.
