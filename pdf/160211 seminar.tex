\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
To begin we will recall Banyaga's Hofer-like metric on the group of symplectic diffeomorphisms, and explain its conjugation invariance up to a factor. From there we will prove the positivity of the symplectic displacement energy and compare our construction with the Hofer displacement energy in several examples. Based on a joint project with Augustin Banyaga and David Hurtubise.
