\title{Elementary But Complex Groups of\\PL Homeomorphisms of the Unit Interval
}
\date{Thursday, April 16, 2015}


\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Among the subgroups of the PL homeomorphism group of the interval is one
fascinating group: Thompson's group F.  The statement ``F is the only
interesting such subgroup'' can be given meaning and the statement was
long conjectured to be correct.  In the last year, other interesting
groups have been found and their properties have been slowly uncovered.
The talk is a progress report giving some results, some strong beliefs,
and some open questions. The work is joint with Collin Bleak and Justin
Moore.
