\title{The Unstable Adams Spectral Sequence for Periodic Homology Theories}
\date{Thursday, February 22, 2018}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The Bousfield-Kan (or unstable Adams) spectral sequence can be constructed for various homology theories such as Brown-Peterson homology theory~$\mathit{BP}$, Johnson-Wilson theory $E(n)$, or Morava $E$-theory $E_n$. For nice spaces like spheres the $E_2$-term is given by $\mathrm{Ext}$ in a category of unstable comodules. For periodic theories I will show how these $\mathrm{Ext}$ groups can be interpreted as $\mathrm{Ext}$ in the category of comodules over a certain bialgebra---the monoid algebra of the monoid of endomorphisms of the Honda formal group law. This is by analogy with the stable setting in which one considers the group of automorphisms, i.e., the Morava Stabilizer Group.  I will spend a good part of the talk on the specific example of $K$-theory, where things are especially nice. Then I will discuss generalizations to higher periodicity, and if time permits, I'll say a little bit about the unstable telescope conjecture.
