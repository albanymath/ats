\title{Families of Groups Encoded Into Thompson-esque Limits}
\date{Thursday, September 18, 2014}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Thompson's group~$V$ provides a way of encoding every symmetric group (and hence every finite group) into a single object, which is necessarily incredibly vast but nonetheless finitely presented.
In joint work with Stefan Witzel, we have developed a procedure for taking any family of groups equipped with what we call a cloning system, and encoding all of them into a single Thompson-esque group.
For many new examples we have proved ``finiteness properties'' similar to those enjoyed by~$V$.
I~will start at the beginning and mostly discuss the (previously established) examples where the starting groups are the symmetric groups, yielding~$V$, and the braid groups, yielding Matt Brin's braided~$V$.
I~will also touch on new examples including ones where the starting groups are matrix groups or loop braid groups.
