\title{A New Description of Tambara Functors}
\date{Thursday, March 13, 2014}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The stable homotopy groups of a $G$-spectrum are Mackey functors, and the zeroeth stable homotopy group of a commutative $G$-ring spectrum has the extra structure of a Tambara functor.
However, while Mackey functors and Tambara functors make frequent appearances in equivariant stable homotopy theory, much of their underlying algebra remains mysterious.
I will discuss a new structure on the category of Mackey functors that provides a new characterization of Tambara functors.
In particular, we will be able to establish Tambara functors as the commutative ring objects under this new structure.
Moreover, this structure has the additional advantage of being clean and computational accessible.
